This project contains the sequential and concurrent ways of execution of python unit / Regression test framework.
Sequential execution of pyunit is time consuming when there are huge number of testcases, this can be optimised to the 1/4 of the time of execution.

Execute the main_sequentail.py for serial execution <br>
Execute the main_concurrent.py for concurrent / paralllel execution <br>
Note the time taken for execution.

The below libraries needs to be installed 

sudo pip install concurrencytest<br>
sudo pip install testtools <br>
sudo pip install python-subunit

TO do:
1. Add HTML Report generation
2. Time for each test case execution
